		<h1>Welcome to Al-Maraam!</h1>
		<h2>Where we attempt to attain higher objectives.</h2>
	</div>
	<p class="xl:w-[80%] text-justify">
		We hope you get the Bulugh al-Maraam reference in that sub-title. If you don’t, its ok! That’s
		why al-Maraam was created in the first place. We aspire to build a platform that allows
		individuals to explore the genius of Islam as presented by its esteemed scholars, both classical
		and modern.
	</p>

	<p class="xl:w-[80%] text-justify">
		As an aspiring student of Islamic sciences, I was frustrated to find an incredible lack of
		engaging authentic content on Islam, especially when it came to classical texts. The standard
		sermons and literature just didn't seem to cut it. Fortunately, in a way, I saw that I was not
		alone in this. Thus the idea was born: why not use my access to knowledge to translate classical
		(and modern) excerpts for a broader audience. Moreover, we felt that we needed a way to catalyze
		the process of research from the scholars. Thus, we (my buddies and I), presented the case to
		the <span class="italic">Ulema</span>, and boom, here you have it.
	</p>

	<p class="xl:w-[80%] text-justify">
		Inspired by the ultra-minimalist, content-centric approach by Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy
		upon him), and the lack of an engaging research-based platform for Islamic literature, we sought
		to fulfil the needs of future <span class="italic">Muhaqqiqin</span> through Al-Maraam, where you
		have nothing but content, literally.
	</p>

	<h2>But, we need your support :D</h2>

	<p class="xl:w-[80%] text-justify">
		Al-Maraam is absolutely free for its readers. But, like all ventures, it costs us, in a way that
		we cannot fulfil that cost alone. For now, we rely on the donations of our generous friends, but
		if you feel that what do here is worth it, please feel free to pitch in. Below is a brief
		breakdown of our costs:
